Demonstrates code generation into style of smardda-qprog,
example of Braginskii plasma transport coefficients and dimensionless
groups in equivalent classical convection problems.

The relevant linux commands are
#compile and link program xpc
cd f95
make -f Makefile.xpc
#run test case
cd TEST
cp test0.ctl test2.ctl
../xpc test2.ctl

Output will appear in 
smardda-misc/f95/TEST/test2_xpc.out
and should agree with
smardda-misc/TEST/test1_xpc.out

The inputs describing the key plasma parameters are listed in commented Fortran namelist
format in test0.ctl.

The files xpc.txt and clcoef.txt contain the key control and object variables for xpc,
and form a basis for documenting the necessary inputs to the code.
Thus
1. clcoef.txt gives short descriptions of the output variables in the .out file
These are of three types
   i.   Braginskii coefficients (in SI units)
   ii.  Dimensionless groups appearing in classical convection theory (eg. Rayleigh number)
   iii. Numerical multipliers (in SI units) of the Braginskii coefficients and dimensionless
        groups, assuming number density in multiples of number_density_factor
        and Coulomb logarithm in multiples of Coulomb_logarithm_factor. (Te is always 1eV)
2. xpc.txt gives short names corresponding to the input variables, useful for
understanding the source code.
